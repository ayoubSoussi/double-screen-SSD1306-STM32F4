# double-screen-SSD1306-STM32F4
This is a library to make 2 LCD screens 128*32 screens to work as one 128*64 screen

## Introduction
You may have two 128*32 LCD screens and you want to transform them into one 128*64 screen, then this library is what you need.
It's a library that implements all the Adafruit-SSD1306 library functions and adapt them to your needs. By using it, you can draw shapes,
write words and draw Bitmap images.

## Functions

- drawPixel
- drawLine
- drawRect
- fillRect
- fillScreen
- drawCircle
- drawCircleHelper
- fillCircle
- fillCircleHelper
- drawTriangle
- fillTriangle

```

## Demo
The Demo folder containts a Keil ÂµVision project and uses the double_screen library to draw shapes and bitmaps on the two LCD screens.
